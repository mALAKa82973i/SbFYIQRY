# Fundamental Skills


A good way to practice your basic arithmetic skills is to visit [zetamac](https://arithmetic.zetamac.com/), which
prompts you simple math problems quickly. Your goal is to answer as many problems as you can quickly. Notice that
because they don't penalize you for inputting wrong answers, try to not guess your answers.

in the form of 97 + 45 = (100 - 3) + 45 = 143, but I would highly recommend trying to figure out what tricks

The following table should give a sense of where you are. This is based off of a 120 second test, with default settings on.

| Score | Comments |
|-------|:---------|
|0-9    |You can do a lot better    |
|10-15  |Below average              |
|15-24  |Average                    |
|35-44  |Pretty good                |

## Number Sense

Number sense is about being able to understand properties about numbers to do computation faster
and be able to estimate difficult calculations fairly accurately. A good example of
what number sense is about can be found at [AGMath](https://www.agmath.com/57427/index.html),
number sense worksheets. I think number sense is a natural extension from the simple arithmetic
you can practice from zetamac.
